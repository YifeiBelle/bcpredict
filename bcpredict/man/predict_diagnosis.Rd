\title{Predict Breast Cancer Diagnosis}
\usage{
predict_diagnosis(newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{newdata}{A data.frame containing the 30 feature columns. The column names
must match the training data features (see details). Extra columns are ignored.
All features must be numeric.}
}
\value{
A factor vector of predictions with levels "B" (benign) and "M" (malignant).
}
\description{
Predicts whether a breast cancer tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M)
based on 30 numeric features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset.
The prediction uses a trained glmnet (elastic net) model with a threshold of 0.4
for classification. The model was selected as the best performer among glmnet,
random forest, and SVM with radial kernel in the original analysis.
}
\details{
The function expects the following 30 features in the exact same order as they
appear in the training data:
\itemize{
  \item radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean,
  \item compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave.points_mean, symmetry_mean,
  \item fractal_dimension_mean,
  \item radius_se, texture_se, perimeter_se, area_se, smoothness_se,
  \item compactness_se, concavity_se, concave.points_se, symmetry_se,
  \item fractal_dimension_se,
  \item radius_worst, texture_worst, perimeter_worst, area_worst,
  \item smoothness_worst, compactness_worst, concavity_worst,
  \item concave.points_worst, symmetry_worst, fractal_dimension_worst.
}

The function internally applies the same centering and scaling (mean‑zero,
unit‑variance) that was used during model training. Missing columns will cause
an error.

The underlying model is a glmnet classifier trained with 10‑fold repeated
cross‑validation (3 repeats) and optimized for ROC AUC. The classification
threshold is set to 0.4, which was found to balance sensitivity and specificity
on the original test set.
}
\note{
The model and preprocessing objects are stored internally in the package
(via \code{sysdata.rda}). If the package installation is corrupted, the function
will fail with an error about missing objects.
